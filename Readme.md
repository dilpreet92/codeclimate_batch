Report a batch of codeclimate results by merging and from multiple servers

Install
=======

```Bash
gem install codeclimate_batch
```

Usage
=====

```Ruby
# test_helper.rb
if ENV['CI']
  require 'codeclimate_batch'
  CodeclimateBatch.start
end
```

If your default branch is something other than `master`, set `DEFAULT_BRANCH` in the environment to its name prior to running.

After tests have finished:

```Bash
# send coverage reports to cc-amend, unifying once 4 reports arrive
codeclimate-batch --groups 4

# custom key (when not using travis), must be the same on all hosts
codeclimate-batch --groups 4 --key my-app/$BUILD_NUMBER
```
